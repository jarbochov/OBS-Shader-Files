# Custom Shader Files
These shader files are to be used with the [obs-shaderfilter plugin from Exeldro](https://github.com/exeldro/obs-shaderfilter).

Currently I've made a two tone border shader that matches an outset border in CSS, and a linear gradient border shader that can be adjusted to change the angle of the gradient and the steps of the gradient.
